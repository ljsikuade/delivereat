# Delivereat

A weekend project, one of my first encounters with Node.js.
I built a website for a fictional restaurant. Food options are fetched and rendered on the page, 
selections are sent to the server and an object is updated to reflect that. I have learnt a lot
from this experience, and all improvements that I would like to make have already been made in a second
iteration of this project (delivereat-with-db). 

# Set Up

```
git clone [repo address]

```
Start the server on port 8080: 
```
npm run demon
```
